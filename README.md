The Hospital Management System is a sophisticated software application designed to streamline and automate the various tasks involved in managing a hospital. This system is built using ASP.NET MVC and provides an efficient solution for hospitals to manage patient records, appointments, and financial transactions.

## Description

At the heart of the Hospital Management System is the patient registration module, which enables the efficient capture and storage of patient details, including their personal information, medical history, and treatment plans. The system assigns a unique identifier to each patient, making it easy to track their appointments and medical records.

The Hospital Management System also features a robust appointment booking system that enables patients to schedule appointments with doctors and other medical staff quickly and easily. The system provides real-time availability information for medical staff, making it easy for patients to choose a convenient time and date for their appointment.

In addition to appointment scheduling, the Hospital Management System also provides an online payment gateway that allows patients to pay for medical services and treatments securely and conveniently.

For hospital staff, the system provides an easy-to-use interface for managing patient details, appointment schedules, and treatment plans. The administration module of the system also enables hospital administrators to manage staff details, including doctors and nurses, as well as handle complaints and feedback from patients.

Overall, the Hospital Management System is a comprehensive and powerful tool that helps hospitals to operate efficiently, deliver better patient care, and improve the overall experience of patients and medical staff.
